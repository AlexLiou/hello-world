Baby's first repository

Hello anybody curious enough to read this,

For taking the time to read this worthless users file, well I salute you. My name is Alex Liou. I'm an average programmer having just enrolled into University of Florida, majoring in Computer Science. I took AP Computer Science and AP Computer Science Principles, passing each exam with a 5. I was blessed with an eccentric and hilarious teacher by the name of Mr. Dencker. His passion for competition programming and fierce recruitment skills got me to join his competition team while his goofy and lovable personality bought him my loyalty. Sadly, I do not think I was worth the effort. While I could solve problems during practice, I tended to lose too much confidence by game time. Perhaps it was because I was constantly being teamed with fellow programmers far above my level. I could not bear to mess up a problem they would solve in half the time it would take for me to figure out a solution and program and debug a solution. I admit I was dead weight, a liability to the team that should have never advanced from the rank of novice. Brett, Ahmad, if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I fear I held the both of you back from achieving greatness my senior year. I'm sure if you had someone of higher calibur, you may have been able to take the first place you two deserve. 

The past is the past but the failures still haunt me. I still chose to engage in UF's Competition Programmming but time will tell if I manage to make up for my mistakes inthe past. Why am I writing something so personal here? I don't know. Perhaps I need an outlet for some ridiculous pent-up emotions. Perhaps I need a reason to be honest to myself. Perhaps I just wish to reward anyone curious enough to read this bio with a pathetic sob story.

My current interests is in AI. I'm not sure if I truly want to make a career out of this, but in the event that I decide that I will, having a robust github repository surely wouldn't hurt. I confess I don't have much of an idea of what I'm getting into. Hopefully, UF's AI club can rectify that. I dearly hope so. 

Well thank you reading all this. If the person reading this has any resource a beginner would find useful should they have an interest in AI, please share it with me.
